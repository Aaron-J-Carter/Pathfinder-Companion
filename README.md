# Pathfinder-Encounter-Helper
THIS IS A VERY EARLY TEST BUILD, MEANT TO HELP ME FOR MY UPCOMING GAME, THERE IS MUCH THAT WILL BE ADDED AND CHANGED IN THE FUTURE

Helper program for the GM to handle combats/encounters in Pathfinder 2e. For use in an in person setting, as a supplement to the game board.


Currently, you can add blank monster templates and edit them to match the monsters in your combat, you only need to create 1 templat per specific kind of monster in the combat. Although there are many things to edit Monsters with, the main things that must be added are the core attributes and attacks, or else the monster will not be effective.

As it stands, Monsters can not add anything other than simple attacks, and player spells can only accomidate untyped damage in a basic saving throw, however there is the structure for monsters to deal with damage types and conditions. It simply has not been implemented yet in the combat section. There is also considerable clunkiness to use if you are not already acquainted with the system, which is something I hope to fix in my next update.


Although there is much in terms of mechanics, like damage types, to add, I would like to work on making this a more user friendly experience by having it open an actual UI instead of a command line program. This is going to take some time for sure, but once I have an actual UI set up, it will make implementing all the other things I need considerably easier, as I can drop things into a screen, as opposed to figuring out how to deal with menu-ing into them only. This means my next update might be awhile, but also it will be actually usable for most people. At least thats the idea
